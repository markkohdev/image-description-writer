# Image Description Writer
Do you have folders upon folders of photos that have lots of juicy info about the photos that you want to maintain before say...uploading them to Google Photos so you can search for "Crested butte ski trip" instead of scrolling through endless photos trying to find it?

This python tool will take a nested folder of photos and turn the directory structure into tokens and apply them as metadata to the images so that they can be searchable on tools like Google Photos and other online things.

## Installation
Haven't made this easy yet...for now it's like
```
git clone git@github.com:markkohdev/image-description-writer.git
brew install exiftool
make run
```
but I'll improve that hopefully!
